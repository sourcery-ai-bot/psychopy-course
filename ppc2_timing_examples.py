This walks you through some common errors which messes timing up.
  1. time visual using win.flip(), not core.wait()
  2. put processing before timing-critical period
  3. put trigger/logging after win.flip() or sound.play()
  4. how to synchronize visual, audio and trigger

The psychopy.org website contains a nice summary of fundamental information 
concerning timing of stimuli and events, with particular emphasis on 
visual timing. See http://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/timing.html#timing
