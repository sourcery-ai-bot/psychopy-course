"""
Timing python code and psychopy using the handy ppc.timer() function.
It's used to identify bottlenecks in the script, especially the part
   within the flip()-loop.

# -------------------------
# TIMING BASIC PYTHON STUFF
# Basic stuff is very fast!
# -------------------------

ppc.timer('pass')  # should give something close to 0
ppc.timer('if 99 == 99: pass')
ppc.timer('if "a" == "a": pass')
ppc.timer('if "abracadabra" == "abracadabra": pass')  # string length means nothing
ppc.timer('myVariable = 4 + 5 * 2 / 3')

# Putting stuff in __main__ and time them
three = 3
ppc.timer('4 + three', 'three')  # using a variable is slower


# -------------------------
# TIMING PSYCHOPY STUFF
#   * Initating stimuli is slow, > 10ms
#   * Setting properties is medium. 0.1 - 5 ms (slower for text)
#   * Drawing is fast
# -------------------------

from psychopy import core, visual
win = visual.Window()
stim = visual.TextStim(win)
clock = core.Clock()

# Checking core.Clock() timing:
clock.reset()  # set clock to zero
core.wait(0.1)  # wait a little
print '\'core.wait(0.1)\'', clock.getTime()  # check the clock. It should be pretty accurate.



"""
TIMING EXERCISES:
    1. How long does it take to create a win = visual.Window()?
    2. How long does it take to reset a clock?
    3. How long does it take to get current time of clock?
	4. Test whether core.wait() is accurate, e.g. by setting it to 7 ms
	   OBS: core.wait() is a slow first-runner. Run once before doing the timing.
    4. Create a TextStim.
        How long does it take to do textStim.text = 'hi'
        How long does it take to do textStim.text = 'hi there my dear old friend. I\'m very happy to see you again! We should meet more often'
	
	5. Pro: Do a multi-line alteration of a GratingStim (rotation, color etc.)
		   and time it including the draw but excluding the flip.	
    6. Pro: How large a text can you put into visual.TextStim.text without loosing frames on your system?
